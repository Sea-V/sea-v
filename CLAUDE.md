# SEA-V — project memory

Read this first. It exists so a new chat can start work without re-reading the repo.

## What it is
SEA-V (sea-v.com) — maritime career platform for yacht crew. Crew log sea time,
certificates, vessels, navigation, payslips; generate a CV; publish a public
profile; collect verified references from past employers.

## Stack
- Front end: **plain HTML + vanilla ES modules. No framework, no build step.**
  One `.html` per page at repo root, one or more `js/*.js` modules per page.
- Backend: **Supabase** project `sea-v` (ref `bnjtrwmwyulvmsautssd`, eu-west-2).
  17 tables, RLS enabled on all. Auth + Storage + one edge function.
- Edge function: `supabase/functions/reference-verification/index.ts` (Deno).
  Sends referee emails via **Resend**.
- Hosting: Netlify (`netlify.toml`) / Vercel (`vercel.json`).
- Tooling: eslint only. `npm test` = `scripts/test-site.mjs` + `scripts/test-supabase.mjs`.
  CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Layout
- `js/api-core.js`, `api.js`, `api-mappers.js` — all Supabase reads/writes. Data
  access goes here, not in page modules.
- `js/seav-*.js` — shared UI/util (cards, badges, config, upload, share, notifications).
- `js/cv-engine*.js` — CV model / render / docx export.
- `js/navigation-*.js` — passage-planning feature, split across ~8 modules.
- `css/` — `core/`, `components/`, `pages/`, `responsive/`. Add to the right layer.
- `docs/*.sql` — every schema change, one file per migration, applied by hand.
- `scripts/` — generators (badges, SEO head, script tags) + test harnesses.

## Conventions
- Commits: `vNNN: short description`. Increment every commit.
- **Release checklist — run in this order, every commit. Do NOT hand-edit
  `?v=` query strings:**
  1. Bump `ASSET_VERSION` in `js/seav-config.js` AND the duplicated
     `const ASSET_VERSION` in `scripts/patch-html-scripts.mjs`. They must
     match — the script rewrites every query string from its own constant,
     so a stale value silently reverts the bump.
  2. `node scripts/patch-html-scripts.mjs`
  3. `npm run lint`
  4. `node scripts/test-site.mjs` (needs a local server:
     `python3 -m http.server 8765`)
- Schema changes: write a new `docs/schema-*.sql`, apply it, commit it. Never
  edit an old migration file.
- Keep page modules thin; shared logic goes in `seav-*` or `api*`.

## Design standards — READ BEFORE ANY CSS OR UI EDIT

These are not suggestions. They predate this file by months and they are the
thing most easily broken by an agent that starts editing without looking.

**Source of truth, in order:**
1. `.cursor/rules/field-label-typography.mdc` — marked `alwaysApply: true`.
   Entity names white, field labels blue `#5bbcff`, values white. Accents
   (silver/green/purple) belong on borders and icons, never on label text.
2. `.cursor/rules/meta-grid-card-layout.mdc` — meta-grid card structure.
3. `css/core/typography.css` — the scale. Stated philosophy: *system font,
   normal case, one body size; page titles only larger.*
4. `css/core/variables.css` — the tokens.

**Tokens — use these, never a raw value:**

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--font-body` | 14px | body copy |
| `--font-page-title` | 18px | page title |
| `--font-section-title` | 14px | section heading |
| `--font-label` | 11px | field / footnote labels |
| `--font-value` | 14px | field values |
| `--font-kpi` | 22px | KPI numbers |
| `--font-weight-body` / `--font-weight-title` | 600 / 800 | weights |
| `--seav-entity-name-color` | #ffffff | vessel/tender/yacht names |
| `--seav-field-label-color` | #5bbcff | field labels |
| `--seav-field-value-color` | #ffffff | field values |
| `--seav-meta-desc-color` | rgba(255,255,255,0.78) | descriptions |
| `--seav-note-color` | rgba(255,255,255,0.60) | supporting notes / footnotes |
| `--seav-meta-muted-color` | rgba(255,255,255,0.45) | muted meta |

**Checklist before editing any stylesheet:**
- Read the two `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files first. Every time.
- Reach for a token. If no token fits, add one to `variables.css` — do not
  hardcode a new magic number.
- Check specificity before writing a new rule. `css/core/layout.css` has
  `.dash-card p`, `.dash-card h3` etc. at (0,1,1); a bare page class (0,1,0)
  loses to them silently and the declarations just vanish.
- Matching a neighbouring rule is NOT the same as following the standard.
  Parts of the codebase predate the tokens (e.g. `.seatime-section-head p`
  hardcodes 13px). Follow the standard, not the neighbour.
- Existing CSS comments record *why* a value was chosen and often name the
  date the user asked for it. Read them before overriding — they are the
  history of decisions already litigated.

**Layout gutters:** a page shell uses one side gutter throughout. Seatime is
28px (`.seatime-shell-head`, `.seatime-section`, `.seatime-shell-card
.dash-kpis-row`). `.dash-card` defaults to 18px from `layout.css`, so any
`.dash-card` inside a page shell needs its padding overridden or it sits
10px out of line.

## Current state (2026-08-16)
- HEAD = v484. Jack pushes every commit himself from Cursor — this sandbox
  cannot push (403), and committing from it leaves stale `.git/*.lock` files
  it has no permission to delete. **Write files here; commit in Cursor.**
- Referee verification email is **live and working** (confirmed 2026-08-10,
  test send to admin@sea-v.com). Sends via Resend from `verify@sea-v.com`.
  The manual copy-paste share-link fallback was deliberately removed — the
  automated email is the only send path and failures show a hard error.
- Earlier "email failed" report is **root-caused and fixed**: the secrets had
  been saved in Supabase **Vault** rather than **Edge Functions → Secrets**.
  No code fix was needed. The diagnostic logging in commit `1afa3c4` was
  therefore never required and is still undeployed (live function = v5).

## Open threads
1. **Rotate the Resend API key** ("SEA-V Supabase SMTP") — the full key was
   visible in a chat screenshot. It is shared, so after regenerating update it
   in BOTH places: Supabase Auth SMTP settings (signup/reset emails) AND
   Edge Functions → Secrets → `RESEND_API_KEY`. Highest priority.
2. Remove the obsolete diagnostic logging from
   `supabase/functions/reference-verification/index.ts` (commit `1afa3c4`).
   It logs `refereeEmail` in plain text (crew PII) and is no longer needed
   now the cause is known. Never deployed, so this is a code tidy-up only.
3. Seatime page spacing/alignment pass — shipped v481–v484. Remaining:
   `seatime.css` still holds ~125 hardcoded px values predating the tokens.
4. Review all docs in `Sea-V Structure/` and list outstanding items (asked
   for, paused on usage limits). Start with `SEA-V-Known-Gaps-Tracker.md`,
   the risk register, the 17-item codes site-tightening list, the MSN 1858
   Am.2 audit flag. That folder is NOT in this repo — it must be connected
   separately.
5. Known security gaps still open: `certificates.attachment` exposed to anon
   via a table-wide grant (fix: re-apply the column-scoped grant), and
   `auth_leaked_password_protection` still toggled off in the dashboard.

See `CHAT-HANDOFF-2026-08-16.md` for the fuller backlog (delete-tests, #509,
#528, #38/#39, #418, #439, ClickUp retries) — absorb and delete that file.

## Working agreement — keep token cost down
The previous chat cost a fortune. Cause: one enormous thread, plus browser
automation dumping whole pages and screenshots into context. Rules:
- **Start a new chat per task.** This file is the handoff; update it at the end
  of a session instead of carrying history forward.
- Read only the files a task needs. Never bulk-read `js/` — it's ~60 modules.
- Use `grep`/`rg` to locate code before opening a file.
- Avoid browser automation unless a bug is genuinely only reproducible in the UI.
  Prefer reading the code, or curling the endpoint.
- Paste error text rather than screenshots where possible; images cost far more.
- Skip the full-repo tour at the start of a session — this file replaces it.
